1. Build and run using Docker Compose:

# Build the images
docker-compose build

# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

2. To integrate with GitHub Enterprise:

# On your GitHub Enterprise server
docker cp secret-validator:/app/secret-validator /github/data/git-hooks/pre-receive.d/
chmod +x /github/data/git-hooks/pre-receive.d/secret-validator

3. For development and testing:

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Test the validation service
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/validate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"secret": {"type": "certificate", "value": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----..."}}'

4. Environment Variables:


VALIDATION_SERVICE_URL: URL of the validation service
GIN_MODE: Gin framework mode (development/release)
PORT: Port for the validation service

Security considerations:

The validator container needs access to git commands
The validation service container runs on port 8080
Both services share a Docker network
Volumes are used for config and logs
Multi-stage builds minimize image size

To scale this:

Add a load balancer for the validation service
Use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for orchestration
Implement health checks
Add monitoring and alerting
